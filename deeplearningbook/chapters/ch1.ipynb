    "&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** is a branch of computer science focused on creating systems that perform tasks that require human-like intelligence, such as language comprehension, pattern recognition, problem-solving, and decision-making. AI is a broad and evolving field that encompasses numerous subfields and applications. In this book, we will focus on machine learning, specifically deep learning.\n",

    "## Machine Learning \n",
    "**Machine Learning (ML)** is a subset of AI focused on creating algorithms, known as **models**, that learn patterns from data through training and are able to make predictions or decisions without explicit programming. The main machine learning approaches are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Supervised Learning**: The model is trained on labeled data, meaning each input example in the training set has an associted label. The model learns to associate inputs with outputs, making it well-suited for classification and regression tasks.\n",
    "- **Unsupervised Learning**: The model is trained on unlabeled data, where input examples do not have labels. The model learns to identify hidden patterns or groupings within the data, making it well-suited for clustering and association tasks.\n",
    "- **Reinforcement Learning**: The model learns through rewards and penalties based on its actions, making it well-suited for environments where decision-making is complex, such as strategic games and robotics.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to these core approaches, there are more specific modeling techniques that can be applied within the context of supervised and unsupervised learning such as discriminative modeling and generative modeling.\n",

    "## Discriminative modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; **Discriminative modeling** is closely related to supervised learning, as it uses label data. Discriminative models focus on learning the decision boundary between different classes or outputs in the training data. They predict the probability of a label $y$ given an input example $x$, represented mathematically as $p(y|x)$.\n",

    "## Generative modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; **Generative modeling** is closely related to unsupervised learning, as it tipically uses unlabeled data. Generative models focus on learning the underlying probability distribution of the training data, that explains why certain examples are more probable than others. They can generate new samples similar to the original data by estimating $p(x)$, the probability of the input example itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{important}\n",
    "A generative model is probabilistic rather than deterministic because it aims to produce diverse variations of a result, rather than yielding the same outcome every time. To achieve this, a generative model incorporates a random component, such as random noise, which influences the samples generated by the model.\n",

    "&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; **Deep Learning (DL)** is a specialized area within ML that employs systems with multiple layers to progressively extract features and identify intricate patterns in large datasets. **Neural networks**, based on this principle, have revolutionized AI by solving complex problems that traditional ML models cannot handle. For instance, detecting a dog in a picture is nearly impossible with hand-written algorithms or conventional approaches like logistic regression or random forests. However, with a large dataset of labeled dog images, neural networks can easily accomplish this task.\n",
    "\n",
    "&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; Furthermore, ML models typically require structured data arranged in tables, where each column represents a feature and each row is an instance. Working with **unstructured data** is far more challenging because individual components (e.g., pixels in an image, frequencies in audio, or characters in text) lack meaningful information on their own. For example, knowing the color of a single pixel does not reveal whether an image contains a dog. In addition, factors like the dog's position in the image or its breed should not affect the result, as the image still contains a dog. Neural networks are able to generalize patterns and extract meaningful information despite the granularity and spatial dependencies inherent in unstructured data.\n",
