    "&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** is a branch of computer science focused on creating systems that perform tasks that require human-like intelligence, such as language comprehension, pattern recognition, problem-solving, and decision-making. AI is a broad and evolving field that encompasses numerous subfields and applications. In this book, we will focus on deep learning, an specialized area within machine learning.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Machine Learning (ML)** is a subset of AI focused on creating systems, known as **models**, that learn patterns from data through training. The main machine learning approaches are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Supervised Learning**: The model is trained on labeled data, meaning each training example has an associted label. The model learns to associate training examples with labels, making it well-suited for classification and regression tasks.\n",
    "- **Unsupervised Learning**: The model is trained on unlabeled data, meaning the training examples do not have labels. The model learns to identify hidden patterns or groupings within the data, making it well-suited for clustering and association tasks.\n",
    "- **Reinforcement Learning**: The model learns through rewards and penalties based on its actions, making it well-suited for environments where decision-making is complex, such as strategic games and robotics.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to these core approaches, there are more specific modeling techniques such as discriminative modeling and generative modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Discriminative modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; **Discriminative modeling** uses labeled data to learn the decision boundary between different classes in the training set. These models classify input examples by estimating $P(y|x)$, the conditional probability of a class $y$ given an example $x$.\n",

    "## Generative modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; **Generative modeling** uses both labeled and unlabeled data to learn the probability distribution of the training set. These models generate new samples similar to those in the training set by estimating $P(x)$, the probability of observing a given sample $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{important}\n",
    "Generative models are probabilistic rather than deterministic. They aim to produce diverse variations of results, rather than always generating the same output. To achieve this, generative models incorporate a random component that influences the generated samples.\n",

    "\n",
    "&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; **Deep Learning (DL)** is a specialized area within ML that uses systems with multiple layers to progressively extract features and identify intricate patterns in large datasets. **Neural networks**, based on this principle, have revolutionized AI by solving complex problems that traditional ML models could not handle, such as detecting a dog in an image. In addition, unlike conventional ML algorithms, neural networks do not need a feature extraction step. They learn relevant features directly from the raw data during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; Furthermore, traditional ML models typically handle structured data,  organized in tabular form where columns represent features and rows correspond to instances. **Unstructured data**, such as images, text, and audio, presents unique challenges because individual elements (e.g., pixels in an image) often lack standalone meaning. For instance, the color of a single pixel does not reveal whether an image contains a dog. Additionally, factors like the dog's position, orientation, or breed should not affect the model's ability to identify it as a dog. Neural networks excel at generalizing patterns from unstructured data, extracting meaningful insights despite spatial dependencies and inherent granularity.\n",
